# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! This project allows you to play the classic game in either single-player or two-player modes.

## Structure

The project is divided into two main subdirectories:

- `single_player`: Contains the game logic for playing against a computer AI.
- `two_player`: Contains the game logic for playing against another human player.

The main entry point for the game is `start_game.py`, which allows users to select the desired game mode.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Run `start_game.py` using Python 3 to start the game.

```bash
python3 start_game.py
